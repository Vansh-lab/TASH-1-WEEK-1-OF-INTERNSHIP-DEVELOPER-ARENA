1-What is Python? 

Python is an interpreted, object-oriented language created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991.Its major uses include web and software development, data analysis, artifcial intelligence, mathematics, and scripting for automation. 
Python's design emphasizes readability and clarity by using whitespace (indentation) to defne code blocks—unlike languages that use braces or keywords.  
It supports multiple programming paradigms (object-oriented, procedural, functional) and has a huge standard library for diverse tasks. 

2-Understanding Programming Concepts?

Program: A set of instructions that a computer follows to perform a task. 
Syntax: Set of rules defning how to write valid statements. 
Interpreter: A program that executes Python code line-by-line, giving instant feedback and error checks. Python promotes modularity (break code into reusable "modules" and "functions"). Variables              and Data Types 
Variable: A variable is a named memory location that can hold data of different types and whose value can be changed during the execution of a program. 
Python variables are dynamically typed, i.e., it's not necessary to specify their type as it is determined at runtime. 

3-Examples of data types:

Numeric: int (integer), foat (decimal), complex (e.g., 1+2j) 
String: str, represents sequences of characters (e.g., "Hello") 
Boolean: bool, stores True or False 
Sequence: Lists (list), tuples (tuple), ranges (range) 
Mapping: Dictionaries (dictionary ) 
Set Types: Sets (set, frozen set), are collections of unique             items 

FOR EXAMPLE : 
age = 20 # int 
name = "Priya" # str 
height = 5.9 # foat 
is student = True # bool 
Basic              Operations: Arithmetic and String Concatenation 
Arithmetic: 
Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/) 
Exponentiation (**), Floor Division (//), Modulus (%) 
String Concatenation: Connecting strings through + 
Example: "Hello, " + "world!" results in "Hello, world!" 
Input and Output: User Interaction 
Input: Use input() to obtain data from the user; the returned value is a string. 
To handle numbers, change the input by using int() or foat(). 
Output: Employ print() to show the outcome. It can have more than one value and can be 
formatted with f-strings: 
EXAMPLE : name = "Amit" print(hello, {name}!") 
The printing can be changed by using different parameters like end (to prevent newlines) or sep (to change separators between values).  
EXAMPLE : 
num = int(input("Enter a number: ")) 
print("You entered", num) 
Comments and Code Documentation: 
Commenting is done by using the '#' symbol and the text is not executed. 
Helpful for: 
Providing explanation to code. 
Writing notes to the code authors or yourself. 
Errors, Their Types, and How to Read Them 
EXAMPLE : 
# This line prints a greeting 
print("Hello, World!") 
Understanding Errors and Reading Them: 
Syntax Error: Incorrectly written code according to the rules of the programming language. Runtime Error: The code is executed but an error is encountered during the execution (for example dividing by zero). 
Traceback: Python displays the error type, the line number, and the error message which gives an indication of where the problem is. 
Understanding errors: Errors should be read from the bottom upwards. The last line (error type) indicates the most relevant information, then lines above show the chain of calls leading to the error. 
Establishing a solid understanding of the Python fundamentals will open a way to more complex programming concepts and real-world             applications. 
EXAMPLE : 
Traceback (most recent call last): File "example.py", line 2, in 
print(10/0) 
Zero Division Error: division by zero
